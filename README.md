## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Javascript


### What I learned

This is my second project using JS and was the domain where I learned the most. 

Some challenges that has resulted in new knowledge: 

- Getting the calculations to be done continuously when input is given
- Handling different kinds of input that could mess with the calculations (i.e. non numbers)
- Handling the tip buttons vs the custom input, making sure not both are chosen simultaneously (uncheck() && radioChosen() && percentage() functions)
- Handling the reset button

In general my understanding of JS's role in web development has increased with this project. Nothing revolutionary in terms of what I have made, but
my tree of knowledge has certantly made some new branches.
